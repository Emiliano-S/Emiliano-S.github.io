But what exactly is IQ? Is it simply a measure of how smart we are, or is there more to it?</p><p class='fw-light'>In essence, IQ is a numerical score derived from various standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence. Coined by German psychologist William Stern in the early 20th century, the concept has become a significant factor in a wide range of fields, from psychology and education to personnel recruitment.</p><p class='fw-light'>Understanding IQ is not just about knowing your score. It's about exploring the fascinating ways our minds work, how we differ in our cognitive abilities, and how these differences can impact various aspects of our lives. In this article, we'll delve into the origin of IQ, how it is measured, notable IQ records, and more.</p><div class='section-header d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center col-12 my-3'><h3 class='text-center section-title col-12 fw-bold fs-2'>History of IQ and Understanding Intelligence</h3></div><p class='fw-light'>The concept of IQ began with French psychologist Alfred Binet in the early 20th century, who was tasked by the French government with identifying students who needed additional educational support. Binet's test measured a student's mental age compared to their chronological age, laying the groundwork for IQ tests.</p><p class='fw-light'>The term 'Intelligence Quotient' was coined by German psychologist William Stern and initially calculated as the ratio of mental age to chronological age, multiplied by 100. However, this method did not fit well with adults, leading to modern IQ tests like the Stanford-Binet and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, designed for all ages.</p><p class='fw-light'>Understanding the intelligence quotient requires understanding 'intelligence,' broadly defined as the ability to learn, reason, and solve problems. It involves grasping complex ideas, adapting effectively to the environment, and learning from experience. Intelligence encompasses a wide range of abilities, not just academic or cognitive skills.</p><p class='fw-light'>Today's IQ tests attempt to measure a person's capacity for logical reasoning, problem-solving, and quick thinking, providing a 'snapshot' of a person's cognitive ability.</p><div class='section-header d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center col-12 my-3'><h3 class='text-center section-title col-12 fw-bold fs-2'>How is IQ Measured?</h3></div><img class='scale-img my-2 img-fluid' src='https://d2bmj4el5t1r3x.cloudfront.net/755832da-4beb-4f69-8b32-f51b47ca0bb0/img/ui/graph-iq.png' alt=''><p class='fw-light'>Intelligence quotient is measured using standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence. Two of the most common are the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.</p><p class='fw-light'>The Stanford-Binet test, an evolution of Alfred Binet's original test, measures five factors of cognitive ability: knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, working memory, and fluid reasoning. It generates an IQ score by comparing the examinee's performance with that of others in the same age group.</p><p class='fw-light'>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, on the other hand, evaluates verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. It also compares the examinee's performance with age-specific norms.</p><p class='fw-light'>In both tests, scores are designed to fall into a normal distribution, or a 'bell curve.' The average score is set at 100, and approximately 68% of all scores fall within one standard deviation (15 points) of the mean. This means that most people's IQ scores are expected to be between 85 and 115. Scores above 130 are considered in the 'Very Superior' range, and those below 70 in the 'Very Low' range.</p><p class='fw-light'>These tests provide a standard and consistent method for evaluating a person's cognitive abilities, though they certainly do not capture all aspects of human intelligence.</p><div class='section-header d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center col-12 my-3'><h3 class='text-center section-title col-12 fw-bold fs-2'>IQ Records and Extremes</h3></div><div class='section-header d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center col-12'><h5 class='text-center col-12 fw-bold fs-4'>Highest Recorded IQ Score</h5></div><img class='scale-img my-2 img-fluid' src='https://d2bmj4el5t1r3x.cloudfront.net/755832da-4beb-4f69-8b32-f51b47ca0bb0/img/ui/pic1.png' alt=''><p class='fw-light'>William James Sidis, an American child prodigy, is said to have had an IQ score between 250-300, but this figure is largely speculative as he was tested using different methods and not modern scales.
